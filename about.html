		<p>...Some of us have been hurt by past relationships, whether or not it was a previous marriage, friendship, or family. We need God's help to get us past the hurt and the shame of those relationships. I have come to the conclusion that those relationships were not strong enough to carry us and in the process of being carried we were dropped, which caused some of us to be broken and others to be shattered. God is here today to mend those who are broken and restore those who have been shattered. We sometimes feel certain emotions after the devastation of being dropped, such as, rejection, bitterness, fear, hate, resentment, frustration and even loneliness. I am here to let you know that we cannot allow those emotions to hinder us from the things that God has prepared for those who love Him <b>(1Cor 2:9)</b>. Inside of me there is the potential to do the will of God. I pray that God will make you Whole in Him. I pray that God will comfort those who are mourning over dead situations. Where they are hurting God heal them, and where they are broken Lord build them up. In Jesus name, Amen</p>

		<p>The <abbr title="SINGLE & Whole Outreach">SWO</abbr> is a ministry that was established to help inspire other single christians to grow and live for Christ. We need to understand that <cite><b>WE CAN</b> do all things through Christ which strengtheneth us</cite> <b>(Phil 4:13)</b>. Whatever your desire is, it is achieveable with the help of God. One of the ways for us to achieve our goal(s) is to not be consumed with the cares of this world <b>(Mark 4:19)</b>, but to cast all our cares upon Jesus <b>(1Pet 5:7)</b>. It is so wonderful to have a savior who is concerned about every aspect of our lives. He knows everything we are going through and it did not take Him by surprise. I believe it's important for single believers to fellowship with one another. I also believe that it's important for the body of Christ to share life experiences (testimonies). These principals can help each of us build a stronger foundation in our lives. Living in this world is difinitely challenging, but through the love of Christ and the support of our brothers and sisters in Christ these challenges we face does not have to be alone <b>(Mark 3:35)</b>.</p></div>

		<p>The goal of <abbr title="SINGLE & Whole Outreach">SWO</abbr> is to empower God's people by letting them know that it is possible to live a life free from sin. When God sent His only begotten Son to die for our sins, He took every sin that had us bound to the cross and now through Jesus we are able to live an abundant life free of sin.<cite> Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends</cite><b> (John 15:13)</b>, and Jesus did just that for you and I when He was crucified for our sins. Here at <abbr title="SINGLE & Whole Outreach">SWO</abbr> we want you to know that God's anointed are laboring for you and with you through prayer and fasting <b>(Matt 17:21)</b>. God did not give up on me and I will continue to pray for you. If there is ever a time when you or a love one need prayer it's now.
